## Inside Out
### Character Ethic Vs Personality Ethic
Character Ethic is about foundational traits such as "consistency", "integrity", "grit"..etc. But Personality Ethic is about higher level learned qualities such as "Positive thinking", "Building Confidence", "Work discipline"...etc.
The writer argues understanding/dissecting the pros and cons these to make good use of habits that can help us become effective/efficient in every day life.

### Paradigm & Paradigm Shift
Facts mean nothing without interpretation. Different people looking at the same fact from different angles (aka 'conditioning') can interpret it in different ways. Paradigm means perspective, point of view, angle..etc. Paradigm Shift means a differing way of thinking about a certain matter. Evolution of astronomical theories; Germ theory; Administration: monarchy vs democracy 'gov of the people by the people for the people'; Transportation: taxi vs Uber/Lyft, Airbnb, shared economy..etc. 

Be open-minded to others' perspectives and be optimistic and don't take things at face value - learn to analyze and assess. This is important because Paradigms define how we see and think about a certain situation and that in turn defines our thinking and attitude.

The writer discusses about how personality ethic can be a quick and dirty fix to a foundational problem that should be addressed. 

### The 7 Habits - an overview
Thought -> Action 
Action -> Habit
Habit -> Character
Character -> Destiny

Habit is the intersection of "Knowledge" what, why; "Skill" how; and "Desire" want.
Eg. one with good family interaction habit :- understanding listening, how to listen and wanting to listen..etc. 

Maturity Continuum: Dependent, Independent and Interdependent Habits discussed in terms of physical, mental, emotional, financial,  intellectual stand points. 
Interdependence > Independence > Dependence   (read: greater than, better than)

Effectiveness: Defined in terms of P/PC (production and production capability) - Golden Egg story from Aesop. Production := Eggs, and Production Capability := The goose.
Product vs The Machinery, Labor, Process around the Product. How one needs the other, P and PC are interdependent.
